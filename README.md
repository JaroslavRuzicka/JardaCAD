# JardaCAD

This is a prototype of drawing app that supports CAD like drawing features. Since this is a prototype and not a final version I didn't focus on a code composition, but rather to get all the math equations right. I plan on refactoring and adding more functionality in the future. 


# Key Features

This app allows drawing on a canvas. Canvas can be moved around and scaled. Individual drawn objects can be box selected either by one or more of their points (select from right to left), or by selection all of the object points (selection from left to right). Selected objects then can be eddited depending on the function you choose.

Window in this project is custom made and it supports all the features you could expect from windows. Like snap layout and dynamic rescaling.
